brewdo
====

brewdo is a wrapper for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) that sandboxes the
installation process, giving you the following advantages:

-   Your user account loses the rights to `/usr/local`, making it
    much harder to accidentally break your Homebrew-installed
    software (or other `/usr/local` software!)

-   Software installations lose the rights to your home directory,
    meaning software will never partially install into your home
    directory

-   A clean way to share Homebrew admin rights among multiple users
    of the same system

brewdo uses [Sudo](http://www.sudo.ws/), but not to run commands
as `root`; rather, to run Homebrew under a dedicated sandbox user
account.

brewdo grew out of the experiment in my blog post, [Sandboxing
Homebrew](https://www.zigg.com/2014/sandboxing-homebrew.html).

Status
----

brewdo is best considered alpha right now; I've successfully run
`brewdo install` in a VM and installed some software from the result.

Installation
----

`brewdo install` expects a system with no current Homebrew install,
though it should work with other software installed in `/usr/local`.
(I haven't fully thought through what it might take to migrate an
existing Homebrew installâ€”see `MIGRATION.md` for current thinking.)

1.  Make sure you have a current system backup, and time to revert to
    it if things go horribly wrong!

2.  Put `brewdo` wherever you like.  Symlinking it into `bin` in
    your home directory while maintaining the script in your git
    clone would not be a bad plan.

3.  Set the `BREWDO_DEBUG` environment variable to `1` to enable trace
    messages.  If things go horribly wrong, these will be very useful.
    Please don't submit an issue without them!

4.  Run

        sudo brewdo install

    This will create the Homebrew owner, create the log directory
    `/var/log/homebrew`, set up a Sudo config, and clone Homebrew
    into `/usr/local`, owned by the new owner account.

5.  Finally, you can make brewdo easier to use by adding an alias to
    your `.profile`:

        alias brew='brewdo brew'

    This lets you just say things like `brew install hello` which
    should Just Work.

How it works
----

brewdo requires a sandbox user account (traditionally `_homebrew`).
This user account is switched to using Sudo whenever you use brewdo
to execute a Homebrew command, unless that command is known to not
require write rights to the Homebrew root (e.g. `help`, `list`).
brewdo also takes care of extra steps required by some formulae,
such as creating (and cleaning up) a temporary home directory for
node.

What install does
----

Here's a short list of the prerequisites brewdo has for operation.
`brewdo install` takes care of all of this:

-   A sandbox user account (traditionally `_homebrew`); this can
    also be created with

        sudo brewdo adduser

-   A new log directory `/var/log/homebrew` that the sandbox account
    can write to

    (`/var/log/homebrew` was chosen specifically so it would show
    up in the Console app, much like the traditional user logs.)

-   The Homebrew root (traditionally `/usr/local`) set up with write
    rights granted to the sandbox account

-   A Sudo configuration for the switch, e.g.

        %admin  ALL=(_homebrew) SETENV: /usr/local/bin/brew

    (This is done by enabling `/etc/sudoers.d` if not already present
    on your system, which I felt safer about doing rather than trying
    to continually edit `/etc/sudoers`.)
