Feature branches a la [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) would
be awesome!

Development
----

I test brewdo with OS X [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) boxes
created from Tim Sutton's
[osx-vm-templates](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/).
This keeps me from inadvertently destroying the `/usr/local` I
actually depend on day-to-day.  If you're developing a new feature
that touches brewdo's machinery, I recommend you go this route too.
